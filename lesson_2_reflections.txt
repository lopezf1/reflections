What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

**  When you initialize a respository, it creates a hidden directory with hidden files that will provide verions control for all your files in the respository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

** The staging area is the intermediate steps before a commit is made.  It allows the programmer more flexibility in grouping files to commit.
