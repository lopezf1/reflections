When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

** Because the remote respository is public, it allows others to review and contribute to my project.  It also allows me to
continue working on my project when I am away from my local computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

** You want to keep the amount of commits down to a reasonable level.  That is, reduce the number and only commit when the changes are meaningful.
